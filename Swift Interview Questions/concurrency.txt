#Concurrency

#GCD

    Dispatch (Grand Central Dispatch) is a wrapper for iOS threading library.
    Instead of creating new threads on your own,
    you are provided with ready-to-use threads.

    You still need to create your own queues if you don't want to use the provided (non-custom) queues.

    Provided queues:
    - Main queue: serial queue on main thread
    - Global queues: concurrent queues on background thread with different priorities (high, default, low, and background)

    Queues can be either serial or concurrent.
    Serial queues guarantee that only one task runs at any given time.
        - 1 - 1 - 1 - 2 - 2 - 3 ->
    Concurrent queues allow multiple tasks to run at the same time.
        - 1 - 1 - 2 - 1 - 2 - 3 ->

    Once you create a queue, you can supply blocks of closure
    as a task (DispatchWorkItem) to be executed in that queue.
    You can dispatch a task either synchronously or asynchronously.

#OperationQueue

    OperationQueue is built on top of Grand Central Dispatch

    Prefer GCD where task is not much complex and optimum CPU performance is required.
    Prefer NSOperationQueue where task is complex and requires canceling or suspending a block and dependency management.
