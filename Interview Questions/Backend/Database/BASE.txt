# BASE

Eventually-consistent services are often classified as providing
BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency) semantics.

Basically Available:
    read-write operations are available as much as possible
    (using all nodes of a database cluster),
    but without any kind of consistency guarantees
    (write may not persist after conflicts are reconciled, read may not get the latest write)
Soft state:
    we only have some probability of knowing the state,
    since it may not yet have converged
Eventually consistent:
    if the system is functioning and we wait long enough after any given set of inputs,
    we will eventually be able to know what the state of the database is,
    and so any further reads will be consistent with our expectations
