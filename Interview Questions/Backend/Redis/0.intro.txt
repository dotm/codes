Redis is an in-memory non-relational database.

Redis is not a plain key-value store.
It is actually a data structures server,
    supporting different kinds of values.
While in traditional key-value stores
    you associate string keys to string values,
    in Redis the value is not limited to a simple string,
    but can also hold more complex data structures.

Each Redis database contains a set of keys (key-value pairs).
Each keys is mapped to one of several data structure types available at Redis.

Redis keys are binary safe, this means that you can use any binary sequence as a key,
    from a string like "foo" to the content of a JPEG file. The empty string is also a valid key.
That being said if you want to use a large key, it's better to shorten it (e.g. by hashing)
