## Key value
Popular DB: Redis, memcached, etcd

one key has one value
multiple keys creating rows

fast because it can be stored in memory (RAM).
limited data modelling because no query and joins.

## Wide column
Popular DB: Cassandra, Apache HBase

multiple keys creating rows
one row key has multiple columns

can group data in one key
schemaless
CQL as replacement for SQL
no joins
easier to scale up horizontally
easier to replicate data across multiple nodes
decentralized
high write, low read, low update

Best for:
- time series (e.g. records from IoT devices)
- historical records (e.g. watch history)

## Document
Popular DB: MongoDB, FireStore, DynamoDB, CouchDB

schemaless documents as containers for key-value pairs
multiple related documents are grouped in collections

fields in a collection can be indexed
collections can be organized into a logical hierarchy (menu and employee collections embedded below restaurant collection)
relational-ish data
no joins
encourage unnormalized data
unnormalized means fast read but slower write+update and makes it harder to maintain consistency
pretty easy to use
general purpose enough

Best for:
- Most apps
- Games
- IoT

## Relational
Popular DB: CockroachDB, MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server

SQL (structured query language)
need to define schema upfront (not ideal for unstructured data)
with joins using primary and foreign keys
ACID compliant to ensure data consistency

check CockroachDB for scalable relational database

Best for:
- banking
- finance

## Graph
Popular DB: Neo4j, Dgraph

the data is a node, the relationship between them is edges

simpler query
better performance on larger data sets
check this out when your joins start to become too performance intensive

Best for:
- knowledge graphs
- recommender system

## Full-text Search Engine
Popular DB: ElasticSearch, Solr, algolia, meili search
Usually based on top of Apache Lucene

document oriented database but with inverted index to make searching fast

a lot of overhead and can be expensive
but can add a lot of value to the UX

Best for:
- search engine

## Multi-model??
Popular DB: Fauna DB

multiple paradigms used and hidden behind GraphQL
ACID compliant
fast

## Time series [u]
## Data Warehouse [u]
