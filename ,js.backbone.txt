#Views
  used to reflect what your applications' data models look like
  used to listen to events and react accordingly
#Initialize method
  the initialize function is always called when instantiating a Backbone View.
  consider it the constructor of the class.
#The "el" property
  references the DOM object created in the browser
  every Backbone.js view has an "el" property, 
    if it is not defined, Backbone.js will construct its own, which is an empty div element.
  setting view's "el" property to div#search_container,
    effectively make Backbone.View the owner of that DOM element.
  Note: Keep in mind that this binds the container element. Any events we trigger must be in this element.

<div id="search_container"></div>

<script type="text/javascript">
  SearchView = Backbone.View.extend({
    initialize: function(){
      alert("Alerts suck.");
    }
  });

  var search_view = new SearchView({ el: $("#search_container") });
</script>
