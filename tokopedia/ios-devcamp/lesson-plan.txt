Introduction
Explain teacher's roles and lessons
    3 session: Swift, XCode, New Technology
    in one session:
        1 teacher to deliver material
        the rest must spot and help students who get left behind
Explain objectives
    to be able to code basic iOS app
    to prepare for the hackathon
    to get internship in Tokopedia

Explain briefly my lesson plan below
Ask students for prior programming experience (so teachers know those who are likely to lag behind and those who are likely to sprint ahead)
    structured programming (PHP, JS, almost any programming language)
    typed language (C, C++, Java, Swift)
    design pattern?? (delegates, advanced students)
    functional programming?? (optionals, advanced students)
