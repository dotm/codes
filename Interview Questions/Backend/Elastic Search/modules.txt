Modules are responsible for various aspects of the functionality in Elasticsearch.

Each module has settings which may be:
    static
        must be set at the node level,
        either in the elasticsearch.yml file,
        or as an environment variable,
        or on the command line when starting a node.
        They must be set on every relevant node in the cluster.
    dynamic
        can be dynamically updated on a live cluster
        with the cluster-update-settings API.

## List of modules

Discovery and cluster formation
    How nodes discover each other, elect a master and form a cluster.

Shard allocation and cluster-level routing
    Settings to control where, when, and how shards are allocated to nodes.

Gateway
    How many nodes need to join the cluster before recovery can start.

HTTP
    Settings to control the HTTP REST interface.

Indices
    Global index-related settings.

Network
    Controls default network settings.

Node client
    A Java node client joins the cluster, but doesnâ€™t hold data or act as a master node.

Plugins
    Using plugins to extend Elasticsearch.

Thread pools
    Information about the dedicated thread pools used in Elasticsearch.

Transport
    Configure the transport networking layer, used internally by Elasticsearch to communicate between nodes.

Remote clusters
    Remote clusters are used in features that work by connecting across clusters on the transport layer.

Cross-cluster search
    Cross-cluster search enables executing search requests
    across more than one cluster without joining them
    and acts as a federated client across them.
