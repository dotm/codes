For example, you want to store a collection of guilds sorted by the wealth of its members.

First, create a collection of guilds
    using a ZSET
    the key specified as "guild:"
    the members are IDs of the guilds
    the scores are the total wealth of each guild
Second, create a guild model
    using a HASH
    the key specified as "guild:GuildID" (e.g. "guild:23")
    the fields are attributes of the guild (e.g. name, wealth, founding date, status, etc.)
Third, create a collection of each guild's members
    this can be done in multiple ways
        using a SET with the key specified as "guild:GuildID:members" (e.g. "guild:23:members")
            the elements of the sets are the IDs of users (the UserID)
        using a SET with the key specified as "guild-members:GuildID" (e.g. "guild-members:23")
            the elements of the sets are the IDs of users (the UserID)
        inside the guild:GuildID HASH
            use a field that has a set as value with a subkey of "members"
            the elements of the sets are the IDs of users (the UserID)
            
Finally, create a user model
    using a HASH
    the key specified as "user:UserID" (e.g. "user:456")
    the fields are attributes of the user (e.g. name, money, registration date, etc.)
Optionally, you can create a users collection
    using a SET
    the key specified as "user:"
    the elements of the sets are the IDs of all users

To separate namespaces in a key, you can use symbols such as / . : |
Dots or dashes are often used for multi-word fields
