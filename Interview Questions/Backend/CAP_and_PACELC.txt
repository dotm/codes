# CAP theorem

It is impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide
more than two out of the following three guarantees.

Consistency:
    Every read receives the most recent write or an error
Availability:
    Every request receives a (non-error) response,
    without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write
Partition tolerance:
    The system continues to operate despite
    an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed)
    by the network between nodes

# PACELC theorems
    if Partition happens, then choose between Availability or Consistency
    Else, choose between Latency and Consistency.

In case of network partitioning (P) in a distributed computer system,
    one has to choose between availability (A) and consistency (C),
    but else (E), even when the system is running normally in the absence of partitions,
    one has to choose between latency (L) and consistency (C).
