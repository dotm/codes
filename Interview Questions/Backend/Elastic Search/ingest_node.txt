Use an ingest node to pre-process documents
    before the actual document indexing happens.
The ingest node
    intercepts bulk and index requests,
    applies transformations,
    and then passes the documents back to the index or bulk APIs.

All nodes enable ingest by default (you can disable it),
    so any node can handle ingest tasks.
You can also create dedicated ingest nodes.

To pre-process documents before indexing,
    define a pipeline that specifies a series of processors.
Each processor transforms the document in some specific way. 
    e.g. removes or add a field from the document, renames a field in the document, etc.
The cluster state then stores the configured pipelines.

To use a pipeline,
    simply specify the pipeline parameter
    on an index or bulk request.
This way, the ingest node knows which pipeline to use.

An index may also declare a default pipeline
    that will be used in the absence of the pipeline parameter.
An index may also declare a final pipeline
    that will be executed after any request or default pipeline (if any).
