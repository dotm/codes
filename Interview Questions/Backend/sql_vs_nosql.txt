# SQL vs. NoSQL

SQL Advantages:
- SQL has more powerful and easy to use language for playing with database.
- Consistency of data across all replica set.

NoSQL Advantages:
- Scalability is better and just works (no setup required) in NoSQL.
- Management and setup is easy. Nothing to provision, nothing to configure.
- The schema of NoSQL is flexible. Changing the schema is painless.

We can combine SQL and NoSQL in one app to get the advantages from both technologies.
