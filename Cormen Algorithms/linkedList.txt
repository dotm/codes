// Linked list

// List-search(L,k) finds the first element with key k in list L by a simple linear search, returning a pointer to this element.
// If no object with key k appears in the list, then the procedure returns NIL.

// List-insert(x) splices x onto the front of the linked list.

// List-delete(L, x) removes an element of index x from a linked list L.
// Delete by element vs. delete by value:
  // It must be given a pointer to x, and it then “splices” x out of the list by updating pointers.
  // If we wish to delete an element with a given key, we must first call LIST-SEARCH to retrieve a pointer to the element.
