When all the elements in a sorted set are inserted with the same score,
    in order to force lexicographical ordering,
    this command returns all the elements in the sorted set
    at key with a value between min and max.

If the elements in the sorted set have different scores,
    the returned elements are unspecified.

The elements are considered to be ordered from lower to higher strings
    as compared byte-by-byte using the memcmp() C function.
Longer strings are considered greater than shorter strings if the common part is identical.

## How to specify intervals

Valid start and stop must start with ( or [,
    in order to specify if the range item is respectively exclusive or inclusive.

The special values of + or - for start and stop have the special meaning of
    positively infinite and negatively infinite strings
The command ZRANGEBYLEX myzset - + is guaranteed to
    return all the elements in the sorted set, if all the elements have the same score.

## Example

redis> ZADD myzset 0 a 0 b 0 c 0 d 0 e 0 f 0 g
(integer) 7

redis> ZRANGEBYLEX myzset - [c
1) "a"
2) "b"
3) "c"

redis> ZRANGEBYLEX myzset [c +
1) "c"
2) "d"
3) "e"
4) "f"
5) "g"

redis> ZRANGEBYLEX myzset - (c
1) "a"
2) "b"

redis> ZRANGEBYLEX myzset [aaa (g
1) "b"
2) "c"
3) "d"
4) "e"
5) "f"
