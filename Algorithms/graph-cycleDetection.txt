Check Cycle of Graph
    for all Nodes in Graph
        do DFS to Check For Cycle and Remember the Path of the Cycle from any node

DFS to Check For Cycle and Remember the Path of the Cycle
    If there's no adjacent nodes for this node, early return undefined
    For all adjacent nodes of this node
        If adjacent node has been traversed before
            then there's a cycle, return the path to this adjacent node
        Else
            after adding this adjacent node to the path
            do another DFS from this adjacent node
                If there's a cycle found, unwind the stack and return the path
                Else, check the next adjacent node
    If no adjacent nodes of this node contains a cycle, return undefined
