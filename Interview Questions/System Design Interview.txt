System Design Interview

0. Introduction (5 minutes)
1. Understand the problem and establish design scope (5 minutes)
  - Clarify the requirements: why are we building this, who the users are, what features need to be built
    - e.g. chat app can be very different for different requirements (WhatsApp vs Discord)
  - Clarify NFR: focus on scale and performance
    - e.g.,:
      - number of users
      - network effects between users
      - soft or hard real time
      - QPS
    - other possible NFR: scalability, security, availability, etc.
2. Propose high-level design and get buy in (20 minutes)
  1. It's recommended to do top down approach (start with REST API)
    - REST vs GraphQL. WebSocket vs Phoenix LiveView
  2. And then create a high-level design diagram
    - make sure all features are covered
    - many designs start with a load balancer or API gateway forwarding to microservices
  3. Do these (create API and design diagram) for all required features (review that all features are completed end to end)
  4. Once completed, create the data model and schema (this can be part of the deep dive below if this is mostly for NFR)
    - Also discuss the data access patterns and read/write ratio
    - Scale can impact this step
    - Database used and indexing options
3. Design deep dive (15 minutes)
  - Identify areas that can be problematic (1 or 2 might be enough)
  - Come up with at least 2 solutions and discuss trade-offs
    - example solutions: reduce call from frontend, optimize SQL indexing, use NoSQL solution
    - discuss trade-offs
      - use numbers to back up your design
      - discuss trade-offs in general and then in specific (for current case)
    - choose 1 solution
    - list out the reasons of choosing a particular solution
    - ask if the interviewer have any questions or concerns
    - repeat for all problems
  - NFR matters most here
  - Work closely with the interviewer on what to discuss
4. Wrap up (5 minutes)
  - Summarize the design
  - Focus on the parts that are unique to the particular situation
5. QnA (5 minutes)
  - Ask about the company, what projects are ongoing and planned, etc.
